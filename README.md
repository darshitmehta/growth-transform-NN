# growth-transform-NN
Growth Transform Neurons: This function creates a GUI for simulating Neuron Models based on growth transforms (Ref. 1, 2). More details about the model and its applications can be found in Ref. 3. In brief, the GT Neuron Network generates spiking activity while minimizing an objective function. The GT Neron model is capable of emulating a number of dynamics which are observed in biological systems, such as tonal spiking in presence of constant input, excitation by sinsuidoilly varying input stimuls, leaky integrator, and as bursting neurons. All of these dynamics can be observed in the GUI by clicking the relevant buttons. Users have the ability to change the input current (DC and AC components), neuronal adaptation, bursting behavior, and the axonal delay. This can be done for an individual neuron or for all neurons simultaneously. Clicking reset resets all inputs to their default values. The GUI can also simulate a network of neurons with inhibitory and excitatory connections. There is an option for generating sparse random connection matrix in the GUI. The user can also input their own connection matrix 'Q' by defining it in the workspace and then importing it into the GUI using the Connectivity Matrix Dropdown Menu. The matrix should be called Q and it should be a square matrix of size = number of neurons. This GUI works best for 1-40 neurons.
